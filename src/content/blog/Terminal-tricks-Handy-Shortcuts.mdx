title: 'Terminal tricks: Handy Shortcuts'

Over the years I've collected a few favorite time saving tricks for working in bash or terminal work in general.

This is one I use pretty often while doing support work. `w` is all the fun of `uptime` and `last` in the space of one letter. `user` is the username of the logged in user. `tty` shows how they're logged in. `from` shows the hostname or ip address they're connected from if over ssh. `login` shows the time or date of the login. `idle`, `jcpu` and `pcpu` are useful for seeing how much cpu time a user is taking up, and the `what` field shows the current command the user is using.

\[root\@machine \~]# w
20:56:50 up 2 days, 1:39, 1 user, load average: 0.12, 0.28, 0.42
USER TTY FROM LOGIN@ IDLE JCPU PCPU WHAT
root pts/0 machine2.local.t Thu22 2.00s 0.09s 0.06s -bash

This group is super useful if you're like me and make mistakes while typing things out.

- `ctrl + w` will remove whatever word your cursor is in.
- `ctrl + u` will clear from the cursor all the way back to the start of the line
- `ctrl + l` will clear any lines above the one you're working in and bring your working line to the top of the screen.

`!!` is an excellent shortcut for appending or prefixing some bit of command you forgot.

bash-4.3$ cat /var/log/secure
cat: /var/log/secure: Permission denied
bash-4.3$ suod !!
bash: suod: command not found

`^^` is a great way to fix the typo in that last command. It will replace everything after the first `^` and replace it with everything after the second.

bash-4.3$ ^od^do
sudo cat /var/log/secure
